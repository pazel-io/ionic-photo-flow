# Ionic photo flow

A fun flow of photo bubbles floating indefinitely and moving across the screen.

It works responsivley on any screen size. Built with Ionic 5 and Angular 12.

## Motivation
This is a sample project for me to try the Ionic animations.

Code calculates the maximum number of bubbles that will fit in one screen width and place them in a way that they do not overlap.





## Demo

## Installation

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```
